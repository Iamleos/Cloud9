Cloud9
======

A Hadoop toolkit for working with big data: http://cloud9lib.org/

As of December 2015, this library is no longer being actively developed or maintained. Please see http://bespin.io/ for its replacement. Why? The Cloud9 codebase dates back to 2007 and has accumulated a lot of cruft; it's time to start over with a blank slate.
